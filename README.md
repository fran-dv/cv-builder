## About the project

The primary goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience with the fundamentals of React, including component-based architecture and state management.

While the original assignment was with javascript, I chose to implement it in TypeScript to follow modern development practices and improve code maintainability, type safety, and scalability. This presented me with some challenging situations from which I learned a lot.
